# Market Research Workflow

## 1. Define Scope
- **Goal**: Narrow down the search field.
- **Action**: Ask the user: "What specific industry or demographic do you want to target?" (e.g., "Remote Workers", "Pet Care", "DevTools").
- **Tool**: search_web for "trending problems in [Industry] 2026".

## 2. Competitive Landscape
- **Goal**: Find who is already winning (and failing).
- **Action**:
  - Identify top 3 competitors.
  - Search for "Competitor X alternatives" or "Competitor Y vs [New Setup]".
  - Look for "pricing", "missing features", or "Reddit complaints".

## 3. Gap Analysis
- **Goal**: Find the "Blue Ocean".
- **Action**: Apply the guidelines in `docs/roles/market-researcher.md`.
  - Is the market underserved (Blue Ocean)?
  - Is the current UX terrible?
  - Is it too expensive?

## 4. Generate Artifact: market_opportunity.md
- **Goal**: Validated idea brief.
- **Action**: Create `market_opportunity.md` containing:
  - **The Problem**: Clear JTBD statement.
  - **The Gap**: Why existing solutions fail.
  - **Target Audience**: Who feels this pain most?
  - **Validation Signal**: Links to forum posts, search volume, or trend data.
  - **Verdict**: GO or NO-GO recommendation.
