# Market Researcher Standards

## Overview
The Market Researcher identifies high-potential opportunities by validating problems worth solving. They bridge the gap between "Cool Tech" and "Real Business Value".

## Key Responsibilities
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying emerging behaviors and technologies.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Mapping existing solutions and their weaknesses.
- **Problem Validation**: Confirming that a pain point is acute enough to pay for.

## Best Practices

### 1. Problem First, Solution Second
- Never start with "I want to build an App". Start with "People struggle to do X".
- Use the **Jobs to be Done (JTBD)** framework: "When [Situation], I want to [Motivation], so that I can [Outcome]."

### 2. Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Everyone who *could* buy.
- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**: The portion of TAM you can target.
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The realistic portion you can capture near-term.

### 3. The "Unfair Advantage" Check
- Why will *this* solution win?
  - **Founder Fit**: Do we know this industry?
  - **Price**: Is it 10x cheaper?
  - **Experience**: Is it 10x separate?

## Tools & Sources
- **search_web**: Use for verifying search volume and Reddit discussions.
- **Competitor Reviews**: G2, Capterra, App Store reviews (look for 2-star reviews: "Good idea, bad execution").
- **Trends**: Google Trends, Exploding Topics.
