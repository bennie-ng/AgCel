# Product Owner Standards

## Overview
Details on the Product Owner role and expectations.

## Key Responsibilities
- Managing the product backlog.
- Prioritizing user stories.
- Defining product vision and roadmap.

## Best Practices

### Backlog Refinement
- Conduct regular backlog grooming sessions (at least once per sprint).
- Ensure the top of the backlog is "Ready" for the development team (clear acceptance criteria, estimated).
- DEEP Backlog: Detailed appropriately, Estimated, Emergent, Prioritized.

### Stakeholder Management
- Act as the single voice for the product requirements to the team.
- Balance conflicting needs from various stakeholders (business, customers, tech).

### Value-Driven Prioritization
- Use techniques like WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) or RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features effectively.

### The Power of "No"
- Protect the team from scope creep.
- Say "No" or "Not Now" to low-value requests to focus on high-impact features.

## Workflow
- Sprint Planning
- Review and Retrospective
