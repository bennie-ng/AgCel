# Product Manager Standards

## Overview
Standards for Product Managers overseeing the broader product lifecycle.

## Key Responsibilities
- Market research and strategy.
- Roadmap development.
- Cross-functional leadership.

## Best Practices

### Market Feedback Loops
- Establish continuous discovery habits (weekly customer interviews).
- Validate hypotheses with experiments (A/B testing, MVPs) before full build.

### Data-Driven Decisions
- Define and track **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) and **OKRs** (Objectives and Key Results).
- Avoid relying solely on gut feeling; use data to back up strategic pivots.

### Strategic Analysis
- **SWOT Analysis**: Regularly assess Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Keep a pulse on the market landscape.

### Roadmap Planning
- Use **Now-Next-Later** roadmaps instead of rigid timeline-based Gantt charts for agility.
- Focus on outcomes (problems solved) rather than outputs (features shipped).
