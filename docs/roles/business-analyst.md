# Business Analyst Standards

## Overview
Guidelines and responsibilities for Business Analysts in AgCel projects.

## Key Responsibilities
- Requirement gathering and analysis.
- Creating user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Facilitating communication between stakeholders and the development team.

## Best Practices

### INVEST Criteria for User Stories
Ensure all user stories meet the INVEST criteria:
- **Independent**: Stories should be self-contained.
- **Negotiable**: Stories are not contracts; they are invitations to conversation.
- **Valuable**: Delivers value to the stakeholders.
- **Estimable**: The team must be able to estimate the size.
- **Small**: Small enough to complete in a Sprint.
- **Testable**: Must have clear acceptance criteria.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
Use the MoSCoW method to manage scope:
- **Must Have**: Critical requirements.
- **Should Have**: Important but not vital for the current release.
- **Could Have**: Desirable but less important.
- **Won't Have**: Agreed to be excluded for now.

### Process Modeling
- Use **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** for creating flowcharts.
- Visualise the "As-Is" versus "To-Be" processes clearly.

## Tools
- JIRA / Confluence
- Lucidchart / Miro for diagrams
