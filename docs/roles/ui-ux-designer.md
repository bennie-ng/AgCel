# UI/UX Designer Standards

## Overview
Guidelines and responsibilities for UI/UX Designers in AgCel projects.

## Key Responsibilities
- User research and persona development.
- Creating wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups.
- Usability testing.

## Best Practices

### Accessibility (a11y)
- Design for everyone. Follow **WCAG 2.1** guidelines.
- Check color contrast ratios.
- Ensure designs work for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

### Design Systems
- Use **Atomic Design** capability (atoms, molecules, organisms).
- Maintain a shared library of components to ensure consistency across the application.
- Document design tokens (colors, typography, spacing).

### User Feedback
- Test early and often.
- Use prototypes to validate flows before high-fidelity design.
- Conduct usability testing sessions with real users.

### Developer Handoff
- Provide clear specifications (spacing, fonts, hex codes).
- Use tools like Zeplin or Figma's Dev Mode to bridge the gap.
- Account for different states (loading, error, empty).

## Tools
- Figma / Sketch / Adobe XD.
- Zeplin for handoff.
