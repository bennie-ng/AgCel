**Ag-Cel** is a local **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** Skills Server that functions both as a command-line tool and a backend for Antigravity workflows. It bridges the gap between local execution and AI agent capabilities by providing structured "Skills".

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1.  **Ag-Cel CLI**: A command-line interface to manage and interact with the MCP server.
2.  **Ag-Cel MCP Skills Server**: A local server that hosts skills and capabilities, enabling AI agents to perform complex tasks.

## Key Features

- **Local Execution**: Run skills locally for better privacy and speed.
- **Skill Extensibility**: Add new capabilities easily using simple markdown files.
- **Antigravity Ready**: Designed to work out-of-the-box with Antigravity workflows.
